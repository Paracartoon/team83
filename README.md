## Evidence and analysis of 5 theme park web sites  

1. https://www.shreksadventure.com

Good ideas:
* open hours in visible place
* book online

Bad ideas:
* A lot of wasted space in the upper part
* Too many imaages and they dazzle you
* Maybe too much movement

3. https://www.etnaland.eu/

Good ideas:
* Interactive map
* From the top menu on the main page you can see all the possible services

Bad ideas:
* The central image not responding to click and seems like wated space, not leading anywhere
* Clear division on 3 types of parks - Acquapark, Preistoria, Theme

4. https://www.disneyworld.eu/

Good ideas:

Bad ideas:
* This website is very visual: a lot of visual effects, but you need to spend some time looking for information which should be in some evident place

6. https://www.universalorlando.com/web/en/us/theme-parks/universal-studios-florida

Good ideas:
* You can clearly see all the services from the top menu on the main page
* Shop online
* Feedback tab is visible but not distracting
* Fixed position of top menu - you can go to another section from anywhere on the page
* Moving slider is not distracting thanks to its size and position (a little bit down)

Bad ideas:
* 

8. https://www.silverdollarcity.com

Good ideas:
* Elegant color scheme

Bad ideas:
* Interactive menu takes time to load and might cause a user to click on something prematurely 
* Interactive slider takes all the screenspace and seem like a waste


## Identification of relevant and appropriate content for the web site 

### Theme for your theme park:

- how about space theme? Or robot theme! this can be fun. Or Cinema theme: attractions are dedicated to different movies! 

### The types of attractions that you will have for the different visitors:

- We could divide all the attractions into three categories, young children, teenagers and adults. the types of attractions will depend on the theme we choose.

### Any other services that you will provide to visitors (for example food, access to money and medical help). 

- Food points, drink points, toilets, point of gathering in case if lost, online booking

### Think of any other information that people looking at your web site will want to know before they come and visit your theme park

- Maybe some certificates for the dangerous attractions?


## Identification of an appropriate structure for the pages for the content for this web site  

Main page:
Head block: title, top menu
Main body: possibly slider with pictures of the rides and of the park itself, sections with small ride images (by clicking on them you get to other pages with description of the celected ride)
Footer: All the contact information + copyright

Contact page
Pages for each ride
News page (discounts, special occasions etc.)

## Design of the wireframes as a clear model for the web site
