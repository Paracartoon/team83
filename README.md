## Identification of purpose of web site to the appropriate stakeholders  
The purpose of this website is informing customers about available services and providing information on how to book tickets and how to get to the park (address, contact email or online chat, telephone number etc)

## Identification of relevant and appropriate content for the web site 

### Theme for your theme park:

- how about space theme? Or robot theme! this can be fun.

### The types of attractions that you will have for the different visitors:

- We could divide all the attractions into three categories, young children, teenagers and adults. the types of attractions will depend on the theme we choose.

### Any other services that you will provide to visitors (for example food, access to money and medical help). 

- Food points, drink points, toilets, point of gathering in case if lost

### Think of any other information that people looking at your web site will want to know before they come and visit your theme park

- Maybe some certificates for the dangerous attractions?
